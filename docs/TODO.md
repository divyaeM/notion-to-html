# TODO

- [ ] add missing support for file attachments (also see: [supported blocks](supported%20blocks.md))

- [ ] refactor code (ie. put downloading / saving functionality into a separate module)

- [ ] fix dependencies / issue with poetry, put everything on pypi

- [ ] finish up uniCourseSummary project (see: https://github.com/sueszli/uniCourseSummaries)

then optionally:

- [ ] advertise
  - [ ] on loconotion
  - [ ] on reddit (see: https://www.reddit.com/r/Notion/)
  - [ ] on hackernews (see: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35316679)

- [ ] make project more accessible for people who don't code, don't have python (= most notion users) 
  - [ ] build simple gui with tkinter (see: https://github.com/stars/sueszli/lists/python-guis)
  - [ ] build executables for windows and mac

then wait 1 month to see if this project gained traction, any issues were reported, any pull requests were made, etc. to decide whether it is worth continuing to work on.

some ideas for the future:
- [ ] make contributing easier
  - [ ] automated CI/CD end-to-end tests for PRs
- [ ] improve performance
  - [ ] concurrently download assets (https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/client_quickstart.html#streaming-response-content)
