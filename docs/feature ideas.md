if the project actually gets some traction, here are some ideas for the future:

- [ ] make it more accessible for people who don't code / don't have python (= most notion users) 
  - [ ] build simple gui with tkinter (see: https://github.com/stars/sueszli/lists/python-guis)
  - [ ] build executables for windows and osx

- [ ] make contributing easier
  - [ ] build CI/CD end-to-end tests for PRs

- [ ] improve performance
  - [ ] concurrently download assets using https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/client_quickstart.html#streaming-response-content
